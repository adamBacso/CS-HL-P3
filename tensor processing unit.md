- application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) developed by Google
- 8 cores 
- 8-32GB of RAM 

- architecture tailored to perform large matrix multiplication 
- parallelism

# advantages compared to [[graphical processing unit]]

- power consumption
- thermal efficiency
- large-scale clusters

# Usage

- large scale model training ([[natural language processing]])
- real time inference - low [[Latency]] -> real time decision making such as autonomous driving
- research and development
