- interpret user input
- each step of *pipeline* deepens understanding
- modularity enhances possible complexity
	- task can be broken down, parallelized
	- module optimized for specific tasks
	- each module provides a more precise output to next
	- easy improvement to any module, entire pipeline does not need to be overhauled
